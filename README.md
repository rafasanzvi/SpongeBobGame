<!--DESCRIPTION-->
<p>
 A refreshing and addictive arcade game based on the children's series SpongeBob SquarePants, made for kids and not so kids, where you can have a good time and have a few laughs while earning points from the bottom of the sea.
  
This project was done in just **1 week** as part of our web development Bootcamp assignments at **Ironhack**. 
  
It was realised by using Canvas technology, HTML, CSS and all the logic made with Javascript.
It is a video game with two kinds of enemies, a main character, shots, sounds, movements, scenery, lives and points. All made with different graphics, movements, collisions and DOM management.
